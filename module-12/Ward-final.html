                        These are the basketball courts of Pioneer Park in Kankakee, Illinois where I can honestly say I have faced some of the best basketball talent in my life.
                        Pioneer Park became one of those courts that if you're not good enough then you'll never see the main court. 
                        It was a hierarchy or sorts, but every young basketball player from this town wanted to get the chance to play on what is considered the "main court".
                        My love for basketball started at this place. I credit it for teaching me a significant amount of things outside of how to play the game.

                        I do not have time to game it seems, but when I do I am so thankful for Microsoft/Xbox Gamepass. 
                        This pass allows for me to pay a monthly fee to have access to hundreds of full AAA game titles.
                        AAA games are games produced by the major gaming companies. Gaming is my getaway when music is not around. 
                        Gamepass is portable and is now accessible from my iPad, which means my wife can watch her shows while I get my quick gaming fix of Forza Horizon 4: Racing game.

                        If you were to ask my friends they would say that I am the best mobile photographer they personally know.
                        I take a lot of pride in this and have now ventured into Sony/Fujifilm mirrorless cameras. I chose against DSLR only because of the lightweight of mirrorless cameras.
                        In my opinion, I have a great eye for scene and portrait photography and would like to explore this hobby a lot more in my free time.

                        I am currently a banker in the midwest region and after receiving my degree I plan to advance within the banking field and create software.
                        Being a banker, sometimes when I run a teller line I notice how dated the software is and how certain revision could allow for significant more privacy and quicker transactions.

                        Once my time ended in the military I decided to stay in Omaha, Nebraska where I made friends that I quickly began to identify more as best friends and family.
                        My best-friend and his father had a siding company in which I became an 8 year employee of as they taught me everything there is to remodeling house siding with different types of siding lap.
                        My position was usually the cut-man, I installed a lot as well but we had enough people to install and I was the only one outside of the owner who knew how to cut at pace to keep up.

                        My time in the United States Air Force was nothing short of amazing and life changing. I was a radiological technologist. 
                        I learned how to perform just about every diagnostic image from x-ray, GI scopes, CT scans, and barium studies. 
                        My contract in the military was short, but as a veteran I recommend it to everyone who is curious. I am unsure if I would re-enlist at this very moment, but if I did I would re-enlist as an Airman again.
